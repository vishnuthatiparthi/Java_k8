Step - 1 : Update the below configuration in prometheus-server configmap.
  alerting_rules.yml: |
    groups:
    - name: datastore-app
      rules:
      - alert: InstanceDown
        expr: up{service="datastore-backend-svc"} == 0
        for: 5s
        labels:
          severity: critical
          team: devops
        annotations:
          summary: "Application is down."
          description: "Application is not reachable. Contact DevOps team."

Step - 2 : Update the below two configuration blocks in alertmanager configmap.
  First Block:
  This block defines where to send the notifications.
      receivers:
      - name: default-receiver
      - name: slack
        slack_configs:
        - channel: "#alerting"
          text: |
            {{ .CommonAnnotations.summary }}
            {{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}
          send_resolved: true
          api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/T07GX6URUQYf/gB098G40NTNW/geQynFNDZW4d573FFxDPyWfrr'

  Second Block:
  This block defines in which case where to send notifications. For example for below case if team, severity matches with devops, critical then it will send the notification to slack receiver which we added in above configuration if not to default receiver which is empty.
      route:
        group_interval: 5m
        group_wait: 10s
        receiver: default-receiver
        repeat_interval: 3h
        routes:
        - matchers:
          - team=~"devops"
          - severity="critical"
          receiver: slack
          continue: true

  Reload the alert manager after updating the configmap of alertmanager with below curl. Update the port based on service port mapping port.
  curl -X POST http://localhost:9094/-/reload
